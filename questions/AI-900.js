      "Which generative AI model is used to generate images based on natural language prompts?",
    options: [
      { id: 0, text: "DALL-E" },

    answer: 0,
    explanation:
      "DALL-E is a model that can generate images from natural language. GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 can understand and generate natural language and code but not images. Embeddings convert text into numerical vector form. Whisper can transcribe and translate speech to text.",
